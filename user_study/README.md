# User Study

The user study consists of two parts: [a] and [b].
Participants are piano or guitar players who are familiar with the instrument and feel comfortable producing short improvisations.

For part A, participants are informed that they will experience a system that recognizes emotions from their improvisations.
Participants are asked to play XXtodoXX emotional improvisations, which are recorded and analyzed by the system.
After each improvisation, participants are presented with three musical excerpts retrieved by the system, and they are asked to rate how well each excerpt matches the emotion they intended to express.
After all the improvisations, participants will listen to each of their improvisations and they will be presented with the actual emotion recognized by the system.
At this point, they will be asked to rate how well the system recognized their emotions.
The last part of study A is a questionnaire about the system and the experience.

The same participants will take part to study-B right after study-A.
In study B, participants are asked XXtodoXX times to play improvisations expressing a specific emotion between Aggressiveness, Happiness, Sadness, and Relaxation.
Right after the improvisation, the operator will tell the participant the emotion recognized by the system and take note of agreement/disagreement.
At the end of the study, participants will be asked to rate the system and the experience.
